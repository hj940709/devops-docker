# Docker
## When to use docker and why
    One of the biggest problems in software development is to set up a running environment. As mentioned in the course material, sometimes applications only "work on my machine". 

    Docker is one solution for such a problem, where it containerize each running environment with exact same condition. Therefore, it can be used when people need to handle multiple running applications, such as database, web server and backend eco-system. On the other hand, with this feature, docker simplifies software deployment. Once a set of images is correctly configured and composed, they can be deployed across different platforms.

    Compared to a virtual machine, such as VMware or VirtualBox, which provides an isolated full virtual running operating system, docker is only a process that contains an isolated user-space and shares the host OS kernel. Furthermore, VM also virtualizes hardware resources such as LAN connection, USB access, and even CD-ROM reading. These functionalities are not included in a docker. Therefore, VMs are more complicated to configure and more time-consuming and resource-intensive to set up since this is almost equivalent to build up a new physical machine. 

    To sum up, the benefit of using docker can be listed as follows:
        * Cross platforms
        * Isolation from other host processes
        * Containerized application
        * Easy to set up (if compared to VMs)
        * Time and resource-efficient (if compared to VMs)
## Example of docker usage
    One example of docker usage can be web development. Without docker, applications such as database, web server, load balancer and etc., have to be installed on physical machines. This leads to a series of tedious installation and configuration pipelines so that they will run properly and interact with each other. However, with the help of docker, what we only need is a well-structured configuration file, just as the frontend-backend exercise. This is especially beneficial for micro-services.
